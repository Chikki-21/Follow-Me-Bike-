# Follow-Me-Bike-
Follow-Me Bike is a semi-autonomous robot bicycle that can detect, track, and follow a specific user based on visual cues and Bluetooth signals. The system uses a combination of computer vision (YOLOv5), mobile communication (BLE/GPS), and path-following logic. The initial prototype focuses on simulating this behavior in a controlled 2D environment before deploying on real hardware using ROS.

FEATURES:
- Person + bicycle detection using YOLOv5
- Real-time visual tracking with bounding box
- PID-based motion simulation
- Basic obstacle avoidance logic
- BLE and GPS coordination (simulated)
- Ready for ROS integration by 14 July 2025

Technologies
- Python, OpenCV, YOLOv5
- Matplotlib / PyGame / Turtle
- ROS (starting 14 July)
- BLE/GPS simulation
