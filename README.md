# Follow-Me-Bike-
Follow-Me Bike is a semi-autonomous robot bicycle that can detect, track, and follow a specific user based on visual cues and Bluetooth signals. The system uses a combination of computer vision (YOLOv5), mobile communication (BLE/GPS), and path-following logic. The initial prototype focuses on simulating this behavior in a controlled 2D environment before deploying on real hardware using ROS.
